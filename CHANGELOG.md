## Unreleased

 * Changed debug level of "Failed message" logging to DEBUG
 * Deprecated LinearDRPCTopologyBuilder, TimeCacheMap, and transactional topologies
 * During "storm jar", whether topology is already running or not is checked before submitting jar to save time (thanks jasonjckn)
 * Added BaseMultiReducer class to Trident that provides empty implementations of prepare and cleanup
 * Bug fix: When an item is consumed off an internal buffer, the entry on the buffer is nulled to allow GC to happen on that data
 * Bug fix: Helper class for Trident MapStates now clear their read cache when a new commit happens, preventing updates from spilling over from a failed batch attempt to the next attempt
 * Bug fix: Fix NonTransactionalMap to take in an IBackingMap for regular values rather than TransactionalValue (thanks sjoerdmulder)
 * Bug fix: Fix NPE when no input fields given for regular Aggregator
 * Bug fix: Fix IndexOutOfBoundsExceptions when a bolt for global aggregation had a parallelism greater than 1 (possible with splitting, stateQuerying, and multiReduce)
 * Bug fix: Fix "fields size" error that would sometimes occur when splitting a stream with multiple eaches
 * Bug fix: Fix bug where a committer spout (including opaque spouts) could cause Trident processing to halt
 * Bug fix: Fix Trident bug where multiple groupings on same stream would cause tuples to be duplicated to all consumers
 * Bug fix: Fixed error when repartitioning stream twice in a row without any operations in between

## 0.8.0

 * Added Trident, the new high-level abstraction for intermixing high throughput, stateful stream processing with low-latency distributed querying
 * Added executor abstraction between workers and tasks. Workers = processes, executors = threads that run many tasks from the same spout or bolt.
 * Pluggable scheduler (thanks xumingming)
 * Eliminate explicit storage of task->component in Zookeeper
 * Number of workers can be dynamically changed at runtime through rebalance command and -n switch
 * Number of executors for a component can be dynamically changed at runtime through rebalance command and -e switch (multiple -e switches allowed)
 * Use worker heartbeats instead of task heartbeats (thanks xumingming)
 * UI performance for topologies with many executors/tasks much faster due to optimized usage of Zookeeper (10x improvement)
 * Added button to show/hide system stats (e.g., acker component and stream stats) from the Storm UI (thanks xumingming)
 * Stats are tracked on a per-executor basis instead of per-task basis
 * Major optimization for unreliable spouts and unanchored tuples (will use far less CPU)
 * Revamped internals of Storm to use LMAX disruptor for internal queuing. Dramatic reductions in contention and CPU usage.
 * Numerous micro-optimizations all throughout the codebase to reduce CPU usage.
 * Optimized internals of Storm to use much fewer threads - two fewer threads per spout and one fewer thread per acker.
 * Removed error method from task hooks (to be re-added at a later time)
 * Validate that subscriptions come from valid components and streams, and if it's a field grouping that the schema is correct (thanks xumingming)
 * MemoryTransactionalSpout now works in cluster mode
 * Only track errors on a component by component basis to reduce the amount stored in zookeeper (to speed up UI). A side effect of this change is the removal of the task page in the UI.
 * Add TOPOLOGY-TICK-TUPLE-FREQ-SECS config to have Storm automatically send "tick" tuples to a bolt's execute method coming from the __system component and __tick stream at the configured frequency. Meant to be used as a component-specific configuration.
 * Upgrade Kryo to v2.17
 * Tuple is now an interface and is much cleaner. The Clojure DSL helpers have been moved to TupleImpl
 * Added shared worker resources. Storm provides a shared ExecutorService thread pool by default. The number of threads in the pool can be configured with topology.worker.shared.thread.pool.size
 * Improve CustomStreamGrouping interface to make it more flexible by providing more information
 * Enhanced INimbus interface to allow for forced schedulers and better integration with global scheduler
 * Added assigned method to ISupervisor so it knows exactly what's running and not running
 * Custom serializers can now have one of four constructors: (), (Kryo), (Class), or (Kryo, Class)
 * Disallow ":", ".", and "\" from topology names
 * Errors in multilang subprocesses that go to stderr will be captured and logged to the worker logs (thanks vinodc)
 * Workers detect and warn for missing outbound connections from assignment, drop messages for which there's no outbound connection
 * Zookeeper connection timeout is now configurable (via storm.zookeeper.connection.timeout config)
 * Storm is now less aggressive about halting process when there are Zookeeper errors, preferring to wait until client calls return exceptions.
 * Can configure Zookeeper authentication for Storm's Zookeeper clients via "storm.zookeeper.auth.scheme" and "storm.zookeeper.auth.payload" configs
 * Supervisors only download code for topologies assigned to them
 * Include task id information in task hooks (thanks velvia)
 * Use execvp to spawn daemons (replaces the python launcher process) (thanks ept)
 * Expanded INimbus/ISupervisor interfaces to provide more information (used in Storm/Mesos integration)
 * Bug fix: Realize task ids when worker heartbeats to supervisor. Some users were hitting deserialization problems here in very rare cases (thanks herberteuler)
 * Bug fix: Fix bug where a topology's status would get corrupted to true if nimbus is restarted while status is rebalancing

## 0.7.4

 * Bug fix: Disallow slashes in topology names since it causes Nimbus to break by affecting local filesystem and zookeeper paths
 * Bug fix: Prevent slow loading tasks from causing worker timeouts by launching the heartbeat thread before tasks are loaded

## 0.7.3

 * Changed debug level of "Failed message" logging to DEBUG
 * Bug fix: Fixed critical regression in 0.7.2 that could cause workers to timeout to the supervisors or to Nimbus. 0.7.2 moved all system tasks to the same thread, so if one took a long time it would block the other critical tasks. Now different system tasks run on different threads.

## 0.7.2

NOTE: The change from 0.7.0 in which OutputCollector no longer assumes immutable inputs has been reverted to support optimized sending of tuples to colocated tasks

 * Messages sent to colocated tasks are sent in-memory, skipping serialization (useful in conjunction with localOrShuffle grouping) (thanks xumingming)
 * Upgrade to Clojure 1.4 (thanks sorenmacbeth)
 * Exposed INimbus and ISupervisor interfaces for running Storm on different resource frameworks (like Mesos).
 * Can override the hostname that supervisors report using "storm.local.hostname" config.
 * Make request timeout within DRPC server configurable via "drpc.request.timeout.secs"
 * Added "storm list" command to show running topologies at the command line (thanks xumingming)
 * Storm UI displays the release version (thanks xumingming)
 * Added reportError to BasicOutputCollector
 * Added reportError to BatchOutputCollector
 * Added close method to OpaqueTransactionalSpout coordinator
 * Added "storm dev-zookeeper" command for launching a local zookeeper server. Useful for testing a one node Storm cluster locally. Zookeeper dir configured with "dev.zookeeper.path"
 * Use new style classes for Python multilang adapter (thanks hellp)
 * Added "storm version" command
 * Heavily refactored and simplified the supervisor and worker code
 * Improved error message when duplicate config files found on classpath
 * Print the host and port of Nimbus when using the storm command line client
 * Include as much of currently read output as possible when pipe to subprocess is broken in multilang components
 * Lower supervisor worker start timeout to 120 seconds
 * More debug logging in supervisor
 * "nohup" no longer used by supervisor to launch workers (unnecessary)
 * Throw helpful error message if StormSubmitter used without using storm client script
 * Add Values class as a default serialization
 * Bug fix: give absolute piddir to subprocesses (so that relative paths can be used for storm local dir)
 * Bug fix: Fixed critical bug in transactional topologies where a batch would be considered successful even if the batch didn't finish
 * Bug fix: Fixed critical bug in opaque transactional topologies that would lead to duplicate messages when using pipelining
 * Bug fix: Workers will now die properly if a ShellBolt subprocess dies (thanks tomo)
 * Bug fix: Hide the BasicOutputCollector#getOutputter method, since it shouldn't be a publicly available method
 * Bug fix: Zookeeper in local mode now always gets an unused port. This will eliminate conflicts with other local mode processes or other Zookeeper instances on a local machine. (thanks xumingming)
 * Bug fix: Fixed NPE in CoordinatedBolt it tuples emitted, acked, or failed for a request id that has already timed out. (thanks xumingming)
 * Bug fix: UI no longer errors for topologies with no assigned tasks (thanks xumingming)
 * Bug fix: emitDirect on SpoutOutputCollector now works
 * Bug fix: Fixed NPE when giving null parallelism hint for spout in TransactionalTopologyBuilder (thanks xumingming)

## 0.7.1

 * Implemented shell spout (thanks tomo)
 * Shell bolts can now asynchronously emit/ack messages (thanks tomo)
 * Added hooks for when a tuple is emitted, acked, or failed in bolts or spouts.
 * Added activate and deactivate lifecycle methods on spouts. Spouts start off deactivated.
 * Added isReady method to ITransactionalSpout$Coordinator to give the ability to delay the creation of new batches
 * Generalized CustomStreamGrouping to return the target tasks rather than the indices. Also parameterized custom groupings with TopologyContext. (not backwards compatible)
 * Added localOrShuffle grouping that will send to tasks in the same worker process if possible, or do a shuffle grouping otherwise.
 * Removed parameter from TopologyContext#maxTopologyMessageTimeout (simplification).
 * Storm now automatically sets TOPOLOGY_NAME in the config passed to the bolts and spouts to the name of the topology.
 * Added TOPOLOGY_AUTO_TASK_HOOKS config to automatically add hooks into every spout/bolt for the topology.
 * Added ability to override configs at the command line. These config definitions have the highest priority.
 * Error thrown if invalid (not json-serializable) topology conf used.
 * bin/storm script can now be symlinked (thanks gabrielgrant)
 * Socket timeout for DRPCClient is now configurable
 * Added getThisWorkerPort() method to TopologyContext
 * Added better error checking in Fields (thanks git2samus)

 * Added Nimbus stats methods to LocalCluster (thanks KasperMadsen)
 * Added rebalance, activate, deactivate, and killTopologyWithOpts methods to LocalCluster
 * Added custom stream groupings to LinearDRPC API
 * Simplify multilang protocol to use json for all messages (thanks tomoj)
 * Bug fix: Fixed string encoding in ShellBolt protocol to be UTF-8 (thanks nicoo)
 * Bug fix: Fixed race condition in FeederSpout that could lead to dropped messages
 * Bug fix: Quoted arguments with spaces now work properly with storm client script
 * Bug fix: Workers start properly when topology name has spaces
 * Bug fix: UI works properly when there are spaces in topology or spout/bolt names (thanks xiaokang)
 * Bug fix: Tuple$Seq now returns correct count (thanks travisfw)

## 0.7.0

 * Transactional topologies: a new higher level abstraction that enables exactly-once messaging semantics for most computations. Documented on the wiki.
 * Component-specific configurations: Can now set configurations on a per-spout or per-bolt basis. 
 * New batch bolt abstraction that simplifies the processing of batches in DRPC or transactional topologies. A new batch bolt is created per batch and they are automatically cleaned up.
 * Introduction of base classes for various bolt and spout types. These base classes are in the backtype.storm.topology.base package and provide empty implementations for commonly unused methods
 * CoordinatedBolt generalized to handle non-linear topologies. This will make it easy to implement a non-linear DRPC topology abstraction.
 * Can customize the JVM options for Storm UI with new ui.childopts config
 * BigIntegers are now serializable by default
 * All bolts/spouts now emit a system stream (id "__system"). Currently it only emits startup events, but may emit other events in the future.
 * Optimized tuple trees for batch processing in DRPC and transactional topologies. Only the coordination tuples are anchored. OutputCollector#fail still works because CoordinatedBolt will propagate the fail to all other tuples in the batch. 
 * CoordinatedBolt moved to backtype.storm.coordination package
 * Clojure test framework significantly more composable
 * Massive internal refactorings and simplifications, including changes to the Thrift definition for storm topologies.
 * Optimized acking system. Bolts with zero or more than one consumer used to send an additional ack message. Now those are no longer sent.
 * Changed interface of CustomStreamGrouping to receive a List<Object> rather than a Tuple.
 * Added "storm.zookeeper.retry.times" and "storm.zookeeper.retry.interval" configs (thanks killme2008)
 * Added "storm help" and "storm help {cmd}" to storm script (thanks kachayev)
 * Logging now always goes to logs/ in the Storm directory, regardless of where you launched the daemon (thanks haitaoyao)
 * Improved Clojure DSL: can emit maps and Tuples implement the appropriate interfaces to integrate with Clojure's seq functions (thanks schleyfox)
 * Added "ui.childopts" config (thanks ddillinger)
 * Bug fix: OutputCollector no longer assumes immutable inputs [NOTE: this was reverted in 0.7.2 because it conflicts with sending tuples to colocated tasks without serialization]
 * Bug fix: DRPC topologies now throw a proper error when no DRPC servers are configured instead of NPE (thanks danharvey)
 * Bug fix: Fix local mode so multiple topologies can be run on one LocalCluster
 * Bug fix: "storm supervisor" now uses supervisor.childopts instead of nimbus.childopts (thanks ddillinger)
 * Bug fix: supervisor.childopts and nimbus.childopts can now contain whitespace. Previously only the first token was taken from the string
 * Bug fix: Make TopologyContext "getThisTaskIndex" and "getComponentTasks" consistent
 * Bug fix: Fix NoNodeException that would pop up with task heartbeating under heavy load
 * Bug fix: Catch InterruptedExceptions appropriately in local mode so shutdown always works properly

## 0.6.2

 * Automatically delete old files in Nimbus's inbox. Configurable with "nimbus.cleanup.inbox.freq.secs" and "nimbus.inbox.jar.expiration.secs"
 * Redirect System.out and System.err to log4j
 * Added "topology.worker.child.opts" config, for topology-configurable worker options.
 * Use Netflix's Curator library for Zookeeper communication. Workers now reconnect to Zookeeper rather than crash when there's a disconnection.
 * Bug fix: DRPC server no longer hangs with too many concurrent requests. DPRC server now requires two ports: "drpc.port" and "drpc.invocations.port"
 * Bug fix: Multilang resources are now extracted from the relevant jar on the classpath when appropriate. Previously an error would be thrown if the resources/ dir was in a jar in local mode.
 * Bug fix: Fix race condition in unit testing where time simulation fails to detect that Storm cluster is waiting due to threads that are not alive
 * Bug fix: Fix deadlock in Nimbus that could be triggered by a kill command.

## 0.6.1

 * storm client "activate" and "deactivate" commands
 * storm client "rebalance" command
 * Nimbus will automatically detect and cleanup corrupt topologies (this would previously give an error of the form "file storm...ser cannot be found").
 * "storm" client will not run unless it's being used from a release. 
 * Topology jar path now passed in using a java property rather than an environment variable.
 * LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variable is now set on worker processes appropriately.
 * Replaced jvyaml with snakeyaml. UTF-8 YAML files should now work properly. 
 * Upgraded httpclient, httpcore, and commons-codec dependencies.

## 0.6.0

 * New serialization system based on Kryo
 * Component and stream ids are now strings
 * Pluggable stream groupings
 * Storm now chooses an unused port for Zookeeper in local mode instead of crashing when 2181 was in use.
 * Better support for defining topologies in non-JVM languages. The Thrift structure for topologies now allows you to specify components using a Java class name and a list of arguments to that class's constructor.
 * Bug fix: errors during the preparation phase of spouts or bolts will be reported to the Storm UI 
 * Bug fix: Fixed bugs related to LinearDRPC topologies where the last bolt implements FinishedCallback 
 * Bug fix: String greater than 64K will now serialize properly 
 * Generalized type of anchors in OutputCollector methods to Collection from List. 
 * Improved logging throughout.
 * In the "worker.childopts" config, %ID% will be replaced by the worker port. 
 * Significant internal refactorings to clean up the codebase. 

## 0.5.4

 * LinearDRPCTopologyBuilder, a polished DRPC implementation, 
 * Improved custom serialization support. no longer need to provide "token" ids. 
 * Fallback on Java serialization by default. Can be turned off by setting "topology.fall.back.on.java.serialization" to false. 
 * Improved "storm kill" command. Can override the wait time with "-w" flag.
 * Display topology status in Storm UI
 * Changed Thrift namespace to avoid conflicts
 * Better error messages throughout
 * Storm UI port is configurable through "ui.port" 
 * Minor improvements to Clojure DSL 

## 0.5.3

 * Nimbus and supervisor daemons can now share a local dir. 
 * Greatly improved Clojure DSL for creating topologies.
 * Increased the default timeouts for startup of workers and tasks.
 * Added the commands "localconfvalue", "remoteconfvalue", and "repl" to the storm script.
 * Better error message when "storm jar" can't find the nimbus host in the configuration. 

## 0.5.2

 * No longer need any native dependencies to run Storm in local mode. Storm now uses a pure Java messaging system in local mode
 * Fixed logging configurations so that logging is no longer suppressed when including the Storm release jars on the classpath in local mode. 

## 0.5.1

 * Changed ISerialization's "accept" interface to not annotate the Class with the generic type
 * Made Config class implement Map and added helper methods for setting common configs
 
## 0.5.0
 
 * Initial release!
