storm-kafka provides a TransactionalSpout implementation for Apache Kafka. TransactionalSpout won't be available in Storm until 0.7.0 (a development release is currently available though). This implementation has only been lightly tested.

The master branch is compatible with Kafka 0.6, the kafka0.7 branch is compatible with Kafka 0.7.

storm-kafka is available from Maven [here](http://clojars.org/storm/storm-kafka). A Kafka 0.6 compatible version is under release "0.7-SNAPSHOT", and a Kafka 0.7 compatible version is under release "0.7.0-kafka7-SNAPSHOT".
