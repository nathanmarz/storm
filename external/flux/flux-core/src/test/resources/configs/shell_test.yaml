# Test ability to wire together shell spouts/bolts

# topology definition
# name to be used when submitting
name: "shell-topology"

# Components
# Components are analagous to Spring beans. They are meant to be used as constructor,
# property(setter), and builder arguments.
#components:
#  - id: "myComponent"
#    className: "com.foo.bar.MyComponent"
#    constructorArgs:
#      - ...
#    properties:
#      foo: "bar"
#      bar: "foo"

# NOTE: We may want to consider some level of spring integration. For example, allowing component references
# to a spring `ApplicationContext`.

# topology configuration
# this will be passed to the submitter as a map of config options
#
config:
  topology.workers: 1
  # ...

# spout definitions
spouts:
  - id: "sentence-spout"
    className: "org.apache.storm.flux.wrappers.spouts.FluxShellSpout"
    # shell spout constructor takes 2 arguments: String[], String[]
    constructorArgs:
      # command line
      - ["node", "randomsentence.js"]
      # output fields
      - ["word"]
    parallelism: 1
    # ...

# bolt definitions
bolts:
  - id: "splitsentence"
    className: "org.apache.storm.flux.wrappers.bolts.FluxShellBolt"
    constructorArgs:
      # command line
      - ["python", "splitsentence.py"]

#stream definitions
# stream definitions define connections between spouts and bolts.
# note that such connections can be cyclical
# custom stream groupings are also supported
