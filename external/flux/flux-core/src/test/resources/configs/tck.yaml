# YAML configuration to serve as a basic smoke test for what is supported.

# name to be used when submitting
name: "yaml-topology"

# Components
# Components are analagous to Spring beans. They are meant to be used as constructor,
# property(setter), and builder arguments.
#components:
#  - id: "myComponent"
#    className: "com.foo.bar.MyComponent"
#    properties:
#      foo: "bar"
#      bar: "foo"

# NOTE: We may want to consider some level of spring integration. For example, allowing component references
# to a spring `ApplicationContext`.

# topology configuration
# this will be passed to the submitter as a map of config options
#

  topology.workers: 1
