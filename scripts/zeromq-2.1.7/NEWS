0MQ version 2.1.7 (Stable), released on 2011/05/12
==================================================

Bug fixes
---------

* Fixed issue 191, message atomicity issue with PUB sockets (an old issue).

* Fixed issue 199 (affected ROUTER/XREP sockets, an old issue).

* Fixed issue 206, assertion failure in zmq.cpp:223, affected all sockets 
  (bug was introduced in 2.1.6 as part of message validity checking).

* Fixed issue 211, REP socket asserted if sent malformed envelope (old issue
  due to abuse of assertions for error checking).

* Fixed issue 212, reconnect failing after resume from sleep on Windows
  (due to not handling WSAENETDOWN).

* Properly handle WSAENETUNREACH on Windows (e.g. if client connects 
  before server binds).

Changes
-------

* Runtime checking of socket and context validity, to catch e.g. using a
  socket after closing it, or passing an invalid pointer to context/socket
  methods.

* Test cases moved off port 5555, which conflicts with other services.

* Clarified zmq_poll man page that the resolution of the timeout is 1msec.


0MQ version 2.1.6 (Stable), released on 2011/04/26
==================================================

Bug fixes
---------

* Fixed memory leak with threads on Windows.

* Assert during SUB socket termination fixed.

Changes
-------

* Checks zmq_msg_t validity at each operation.

* Inproc performance tests now work on Windows.

* PGM wire format specification improved in zmq_pgm(7)

* Added thread latency/throughput performance examples.

* Added "--with-system-pgm" configure option to use already installed
  OpenPGM.


0MQ version 2.1.5 (Broken), released on 2011/04/20
==================================================

Note that this version contained a malformed patch and is not usable.
It is not available for download, but is available in the git via the
2.1.5 tag.


0MQ version 2.1.4 (Stable), released on 2011/03/30
==================================================

Bug fixes
---------

* Fix to OpenPGM which was asserting on small messages (Steven McCoy).

Changes
-------

* Upgraded OpenPGM to version 5.1.115 (Pieter Hintjens).

* OpenPGM build changed to not install OpenPGM artifacts.


0MQ version 2.1.3 (Stable), released on 2011/03/21
==================================================

Bug fixes
---------

* Fix to PUSH sockets, which would sometimes deliver tail frames of a
  multipart message to new subscribers (Martin Sustrik).

* Fix to PUB sockets, which would sometimes deliver tail frames of a
  multipart message to new subscribers (Martin Sustrik).

* Windows build was broken due to EPROTONOSUPPORT not being defined. This
  has now been fixed (Martin Sustrik).

* Various fixes to make OpenVMS port work (Brett Cameron).

* Corrected Reference Manual to note that ZMQ_LINGER socket option may be
  set at any time, not just before connecting/binding (Pieter Hintjens).

* Fix to C++ binding to properly close sockets (Guido Goldstein).

* Removed obsolete assert from pgm_socket.cpp (Martin Sustrik).

Changes
-------

* Removed stand-alone devices (/devices subdirectory) from distribution.
  These undocumented programs remain available in older packages (Pieter
  Hintjens).

* OpenPGM default rate raised to 40mbps by default (Steven McCoy).

* ZMQ_DEALER and ZMQ_ROUTER macros provided to ease upgrade to 0MQ/3.0.
  These are scheduled to replace ZMQ_XREQ and ZMQ_XREP (Pieter Hintjens).

* Added man page for zmq_device(3) which was hereto undocumented (Pieter
  Hintjens).

* Removed zmq_queue(3), zmq_forwarder(3), zmq_streamer(3) man pages
  (Pieter Hintjens).

OpenPGM Integration
-------------------

* Upgraded OpenPGM to version 5.1.114 (Steven McCoy, Mikko Koppanen).

* Build system now calls OpenPGM build process directly, allowing easier
  future upgrades of OpenPGM (Mikko Koppanen).

* Build system allows configuration with arbitrary versions of OpenPGM
  (./configure --with-pgm=libpgm-x.y.z) (Mikko Koppanen).

* OpenPGM uses new PGM_ODATA_MAX_RTE controlling original data instead of
  PGM_TXW_MAX_RTE covering entire channel (Steven McCoy).

Building
--------

* 0MQ builds properly on FreeBSD (Mikko Koppanen).


0MQ version 2.1.2 (rc2), released on 2011/03/06
===============================================

Bug fixes
---------

* 0MQ now correctly handles durable inproc sockets; previously it ignored
  explicit identities on inproc sockets.

* Various memory leaks were fixed.

* OpenPGM sender/receiver creation fixed.


0MQ version 2.1.1 (rc1), released on 2011/02/23
===============================================

New functionality
-----------------

* New socket option ZMQ_RECONNECT_IVL_MAX added, allows for exponential
  back-off strategy when reconnecting.

* New socket option ZMQ_RECOVERY_IVL_MSEC added, as a fine-grained
  counterpart to ZMQ_RECOVERY_IVL (for multicast transports).

* If memory is exhausted, 0MQ warns with an explicit message before
  aborting the process.

* Size of inproc HWM and SWAP is sum of peers' HWMs and SWAPs (Douglas
  Greager, Martin Sustrik).

Bug fixes
---------

* 0MQ no longer asserts in mailbox.cpp when multiple peers connect with
  the same identity.

* 0MQ no longer asserts when rejecting an oversized message.

* 0MQ no longer asserts in pipe.cpp when the swap fills up.

* zmq_poll now works correctly with an empty poll set.

* Many more.

Building
--------

* 0MQ now builds correctly on CentOS, Debian 6, and SunOS/gcc3.

* Added WithOpenPGM configuration into MSVC builds.

Known issues
------------

* OpenPGM integration is still not fully stable.


0MQ version 2.1.0 (Beta), released on 2010/12/01
================================================

New functionality
-----------------

* New semantics for zmq_close () and zmq_term () ensure that all messages
  are sent before the application terminates. This behaviour may be
  modified using the new ZMQ_LINGER socket option; for further details
  refer to the reference manual.

* The new socket options ZMQ_FD and ZMQ_EVENTS provide a way to integrate
  0MQ sockets into existing poll/event loops.

* Sockets may now be migrated between OS threads, as long as the
  application ensures that a full memory barrier is issued.

* The 0MQ ABI exported by libzmq.so has been formalised; DSO symbol
  visibility is used on supported platforms to ensure that only public ABI
  symbols are exported. The library ABI version has been set to 1.0.0 for
  this release.

* OpenPGM has been updated to version 5.0.92. This version no longer
  depends on GLIB, and integration with 0MQ should be much improved.

* zmq_poll() now honors timeouts precisely, and no longer returns if no
  events are signaled.

* Blocking calls now return EINTR if interrupted by the delivery of a
  signal; this also means that language bindings which previously had
  problems with handling SIGINT/^C should now work correctly.

* The ZMQ_TYPE socket option was added; this allows retrieval of the socket
  type after creation.

* Added a ZMQ_VERSION macro to zmq.h for compile-time API version
  detection.

* The ZMQ_RECONNECT_IVL and ZMQ_BACKLOG socket options have been added.

Bug fixes
---------

* Forwarder and streamer devices now handle multi-part messages correctly.

* 0MQ no longer asserts when malformed data is received on the wire.

* 0MQ internal timers now work correctly if the TSC jumps backwards.

* The internal signalling functionality (mailbox) has been improved
  to automatically resize socket buffers on POSIX systems.

* Many more.

Building
--------

* 0MQ now builds correctly with many more non-GCC compilers (Sun Studio,
  Intel ICC, CLang).

* AIX and HP-UX builds should work now.

* FD_SETSIZE has been set to 1024 by default for MSVC builds.

* Windows builds using GCC (MinGW) now work out of the box.

Distribution
------------

* A simple framework for regression tests has been added, along with a few
  basic self-tests. The tests can be run using "make check".
