zmq_bind(3)
===========


NAME
----
zmq_bind - accept connections on a socket


SYNOPSIS
--------
*int zmq_bind (void '*socket', const char '*endpoint');*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _zmq_bind()_ function shall create an endpoint for accepting connections
and bind it to the socket referenced by the 'socket' argument.

The 'endpoint' argument is a string consisting of two parts as follows:
'transport'`://`'address'. The 'transport' part specifies the underlying
transport protocol to use. The meaning of the 'address' part is specific to
the underlying transport protocol selected.

The following transports are defined:

'inproc':: local in-process (inter-thread) communication transport, see linkzmq:zmq_inproc[7]
'ipc':: local inter-process communication transport, see linkzmq:zmq_ipc[7]
'tcp':: unicast transport using TCP, see linkzmq:zmq_tcp[7]
'pgm', 'epgm':: reliable multicast transport using PGM, see linkzmq:zmq_pgm[7]

With the exception of 'ZMQ_PAIR' sockets, a single socket may be connected to
multiple endpoints using _zmq_connect()_, while simultaneously accepting
incoming connections from multiple endpoints bound to the socket using
_zmq_bind()_. Refer to linkzmq:zmq_socket[3] for a description of the exact
semantics involved when connecting or binding a socket to multiple endpoints.


RETURN VALUE
------------
The _zmq_bind()_ function shall return zero if successful. Otherwise it shall
return `-1` and set 'errno' to one of the values defined below.


ERRORS
------
*EPROTONOSUPPORT*::
The requested 'transport' protocol is not supported.
*ENOCOMPATPROTO*::
The requested 'transport' protocol is not compatible with the socket type.
*EADDRINUSE*::
The requested 'address' is already in use.
*EADDRNOTAVAIL*::
The requested 'address' was not local.
*ENODEV*::
The requested 'address' specifies a nonexistent interface.
*ETERM*::
The 0MQ 'context' associated with the specified 'socket' was terminated.
*ENOTSOCK*::
The provided 'socket' was invalid.
*EMTHREAD*::
No I/O thread is available to accomplish the task.


EXAMPLE
-------
.Binding a publisher socket to an in-process and a TCP transport
----
/* Create a ZMQ_PUB socket */
void *socket = zmq_socket (context, ZMQ_PUB);
assert (socket);
/* Bind it to a in-process transport with the address 'my_publisher' */
int rc = zmq_bind (socket, "inproc://my_publisher");
assert (rc == 0);
/* Bind it to a TCP transport on port 5555 of the 'eth0' interface */
rc = zmq_bind (socket, "tcp://eth0:5555");
assert (rc == 0);
