zmq_errno(3)
============


NAME
----
zmq_errno - retrieve value of errno for the calling thread


SYNOPSIS
--------
*int zmq_errno (void);*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _zmq_errno()_ function shall retrieve the value of the 'errno' variable for
the calling thread.

The _zmq_errno()_ function is provided to assist users on non-POSIX systems who
are experiencing issues with retrieving the correct value of 'errno' directly.
Specifically, users on Win32 systems whose application is using a different C
run-time library from the C run-time library in use by 0MQ will need to use
_zmq_errno()_ for correct operation.

IMPORTANT: Users not experiencing issues with retrieving the correct value of
'errno' should not use this function and should instead access the 'errno'
variable directly.


RETURN VALUE
------------
The _zmq_errno()_ function shall return the value of the 'errno' variable for
the calling thread.


ERRORS
------
No errors are defined.
