zmq_init(3)
===========


NAME
----
zmq_init - initialise 0MQ context


SYNOPSIS
--------
*void *zmq_init (int 'io_threads');*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _zmq_init()_ function initialises a 0MQ 'context'.

The 'io_threads' argument specifies the size of the 0MQ thread pool to handle
I/O operations. If your application is using only the 'inproc' transport for
messaging you may set this to zero, otherwise set it to at least one.

.Thread safety
A 0MQ 'context' is thread safe and may be shared among as many application
threads as necessary, without any additional locking required on the part of
the caller.


RETURN VALUE
------------
The _zmq_init()_ function shall return an opaque handle to the initialised
'context' if successful. Otherwise it shall return NULL and set 'errno' to one
of the values defined below.


ERRORS
------
*EINVAL*::
An invalid number of 'io_threads' was requested.
