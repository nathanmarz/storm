Licensing information for the included OpenPGM library

License:
    Most of OpenPGM is licensed under the terms of the GNU Lesser Public
    License, the LGPL, see the file COPYING for details.

    The ultra-high performance partial checksum & folding routines that are
    taken from the Linux kernel and licensed under the terms of the GNU General
    Public License, the GPL, see the file COPYING.GPL for details.

    Hence you should treat the libraries libpgm, libpgmsnmp, and libpgmhttp of
    OpenPGM as being LGPL licensed and the library libpgmplus as being GPL
    licensed.

(Packager's note: "GPL" in the context of the Linux kernel means GPL 2.  0MQ
doesn't use those files during build or runtime, so it is not relevant for the
license of zeromq itself.))

Commercial licenses are also offered.
