;; daemons have a single thread that will respond to events
;; start with initialize event
;; callbacks add events to the thread's queue

;; keeps in memory cache of the state, only for what client subscribes to. Any subscription is automatically kept in sync, and when there are changes, client is notified.
;; master gives orders through state, and client records status in state (ephemerally)

;; master tells nodes what workers to launch

;; master writes this. supervisors and workers subscribe to this to understand complete topology. each storm is a map from nodes to workers to tasks to ports whenever topology changes everyone will be notified
;; master includes timestamp of each assignment so that appropriate time can be given to each worker to start up
;; /assignments/{storm id}

;; which tasks they talk to, etc. (immutable until shutdown)
;; everyone reads this in full to understand structure
;; /tasks/{storm id}/{task id} ; just contains bolt id


;; supervisors send heartbeats here, master doesn't subscribe but checks asynchronously
;; /supervisors/status/{ephemeral node ids}  ;; node metadata such as port ranges are kept here 

;; tasks send heartbeats here, master doesn't subscribe, just checks asynchronously
;; /taskbeats/{storm id}/{ephemeral task id}

;; contains data about whether it's started or not, tasks and workers subscribe to specific storm here to know when to shutdown
;; master manipulates
;; /storms/{storm id}



;; Zookeeper flows:

;; Master:
;; job submit:
;; 1. read which nodes are available
;; 2. set up the worker/{storm}/{task} stuff (static)
;; 3. set assignments
;; 4. start storm - necessary in case master goes down, when goes back up can remember to take down the storm (2 states: on or off)

;; Monitoring (or by checking when nodes go down or heartbeats aren't received):
;; 1. read assignment
;; 2. see which tasks/nodes are up
;; 3. make new assignment to fix any problems
;; 4. if a storm exists but is not taken down fully, ensure that storm takedown is launched (step by step remove tasks and finally remove assignments)


;; masters only possible watches is on ephemeral nodes and tasks, and maybe not even

;; Supervisor:
;; 1. monitor /storms/* and assignments
;; 2. local state about which workers are local
;; 3. when storm is on, check that workers are running locally & start/kill if different than assignments
;; 4. when storm is off, monitor tasks for workers - when they all die or don't hearbeat, kill the process and cleanup

;; Worker:
;; 1. On startup, start the tasks if the storm is on

;; Task:
;; 1. monitor assignments, reroute when assignments change
;; 2. monitor storm (when storm turns off, error if assignments change) - take down tasks as master turns them off



;; locally on supervisor: workers write pids locally on startup, supervisor deletes it on shutdown (associates pid with worker name)
;; supervisor periodically checks to make sure processes are alive
;; {rootdir}/workers/{storm id}/{worker id}   ;; contains pid inside

;; all tasks in a worker share the same cluster state
;; workers, supervisors, and tasks subscribes to storm to know when it's started or stopped
;; on stopped, master removes records in order (tasks need to subscribe to themselves to see if they disappear)
;; when a master removes a worker, the supervisor should kill it (and escalate to kill -9)
;; on shutdown, tasks subscribe to tasks that send data to them to wait for them to die. when node disappears, they can die
