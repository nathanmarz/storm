 * StateStorage provides the API for the pluggable state store used by the

 * listing sub-paths at a given path.

 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTE:
 * Heartbeats have different api calls used to interact with them. The root
 * path (/) may or may not be the same as the root path for the other api calls.
 *
 * For example, performing these two calls:
 *     set_data("/path", data, acls);
 *     void set_worker_hb("/path", heartbeat, acls);
 * may or may not cause a collision in "/path".
 * Never use the same paths with the *_hb* methods as you do with the others.
