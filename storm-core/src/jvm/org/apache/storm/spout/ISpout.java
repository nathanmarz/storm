/**
 * ISpout is the core interface for implementing spouts. A Spout is responsible
 * for feeding messages into the topology for processing. For every tuple emitted by
 * a spout, Storm will track the (potentially very large) DAG of tuples generated
 * based on a tuple emitted by the spout. When Storm detects that every tuple in
 * that DAG has been successfully processed, it will send an ack message to the Spout.
 *
 * If a tuple fails to be fully processed within the configured timeout for the
 * topology (see {@link org.apache.storm.Config}), Storm will send a fail message to the spout
 * for the message.
 *
 * When a Spout emits a tuple, it can tag the tuple with a message id. The message id
 * can be any type. When Storm acks or fails a message, it will pass back to the
 * spout the same message id to identify which tuple it's referring to. If the spout leaves out
 * the message id, or sets it to null, then Storm will not track the message and the spout
 * will not receive any ack or fail callbacks for the message.
 *
 * Storm executes ack, fail, and nextTuple all on the same thread. This means that an implementor
 * of an ISpout does not need to worry about concurrency issues between those methods. However, it 
 * also means that an implementor must ensure that nextTuple is non-blocking: otherwise 
 * the method could block acks and fails that are pending to be processed.
